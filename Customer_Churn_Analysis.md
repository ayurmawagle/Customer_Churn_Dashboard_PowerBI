## Project Overview
Customer churn analysis is an in-depth analysis of customer churn of a mobile network company in the United States. This project demonstrates the application of data visualization techniques and interactive analytics to derive actionable insights from complex customer data.

## Methodology
### Data Preparation and ETL
- Utilized Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
- Implemented data modeling techniques to establish relationships between tables

### Dashboard Development
Developed using Power BI Desktop, incorporating:
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced calculations
- Custom visuals for enhanced data representation
- Cross-filtering and drill-through capabilities for interactive analysis
  
### Dashboard Components
1. Churn Reasons Analysis
- Top 10 reasons for churn 
- Number of churned customers by churn category 

2. Demographic Analysis
- Churn by age bins (Column chart)
- Churn rate by age (Line chart)

3. Geographical Analysis
- Churn rate by state (Map visualization)

4. Customer Lifecycle Analysis
- Churn rate by account length (Line chart)
  
5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total customers
- Number of churned customers
- Overall churn rate
  
6. Contract Type Analysis
- Monthly contract churn rate
- Yearly contract churn rate

## Interactive Features
- Each visual incorporates click-through filters, enabling dynamic cross-filtering across the dashboard
- Slicers for contract type (monthly/yearly) affect all visualizations simultaneously
- Tooltip enhancements for detailed information on hover

## Key Findings
1. Churn Drivers:
- Primary: Competitor offers
