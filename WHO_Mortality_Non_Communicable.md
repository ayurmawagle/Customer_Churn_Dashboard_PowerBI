Dataset: WHO Global Health Estimates - Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs)

This dataset, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), contains mortality estimates for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) globally. It includes:

- Mortality data for various NCDs including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes
- Estimates broken down by country, region, age group, and sex
- Data spanning multiple years, providing trends over time
- Cause-specific death rates and proportional mortality

The dataset is crucial for understanding the global burden of NCDs, identifying high-risk populations, and tracking progress in reducing NCD-related mortality. It's valuable for public health research, policy-making, and healthcare planning.
